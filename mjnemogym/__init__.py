MJ NeMo Gym - Offline Scoring Functions for 6 Domains

This package provides standalone reward functions that can run without
the NemoGym server infrastructure.

Usage:
    from mjnemogym import score_fn_dict, get_score_fn

    # Get score function by data_source
    score_fn = score_fn_dict["nemogym_math"]
    reward = score_fn(model_output="\\boxed{42}", label="42")

    # Or use the helper function
    reward = get_score_fn("nemogym_math")(model_output="\\boxed{42}", label="42")
